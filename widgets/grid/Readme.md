The grid widget will print out data from a data source in a certian layout ( table, list, etc) with fields, filters, sorting controls, and pagination controls.<br />

Examples:<br />

The news-news-archive repo is a simple implementations with a basic table grid and largely default settings being used.<br />

The news-features-archive repo is an intermediate implementation that sets up a table, with custom settings and filters.<br />

The findALab repo is an advanced implementation that sets up the table with advanced SQL and filters that are outside of the grid.<br />

Types of Grids:<br />

Currently only a table grid exists ( table.cfc ) but hopefully a list grid will be created soon.<br />
